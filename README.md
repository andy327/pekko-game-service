## Overview

**Pekko Game Service** is a multiplayer turn-based game backend built in **Scala**, leveraging modern libraries and actor-based concurrency for clean, modular game logic. It supports multiple game types, lobby management, and persistent storage.

### ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **Scala 2.13** + **Pekko Typed Actors** for scalable, actor-based game orchestration
- **Pekko HTTP** for building RESTful APIs
- **Cats-Effect** for safe, composable side effects and integration with Doobie
- **Doobie** + **PostgreSQL** for persistent game state storage
- **Circe** for JSON (de)serialization of game state
- **Spray-Json** for API request/response formats
- **JWT authentication** for secure player actions
- **Scaffeine** for lightweight caching
- **Testcontainers** for integration testing with real databases
- **Modular game architecture** via a generic `GameRegistry` and game-specific modules

### ðŸš€ DevOps / CI/CD

- **GitHub Actions** for automated testing and code quality checks
- **Codecov** integration for test coverage reporting
- **Render.com** for continuous deployment of the HTTP API
- **Docker** for local development and deployment consistency

### ðŸŽ® Features

- Full lobby lifecycle: create, join, start, and list lobbies
- Generic support for multiple game types (e.g., TicTacToe, more to come)
- Decoupled game logic and API layers for flexibility
- Ready for WebSocket and player actor extensions (planned)
